    """Connect to *(host, port)* and return a connected socket.

    This function implements :rfc:`6555` Happy Eyeballs and some features of
    :rfc:`8305` Happy Eyeballs v2. When a host name resolves to multiple IP
    addresses, connection attempts are made in parallel with staggered start
    times, and the one completing fastest is used. The resolved addresses can
    be interleaved by address family, so even if network connectivity for one
    address family is broken (when IPv6 fails, for example), connections
    still complete quickly. IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of a hostname can also
    be resolved in parallel.

    (Some fancier features specified in :rfc:`8305`, like
    statefulness and features related to NAT64 and DNS64 are not
    implemented. Destination address sorting is left for the operating
    system; it is assumed that the addresses returned by
    :func:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.getaddrinfo` is already sorted
    according to OS's preferences.)

    Most of the arguments should be familiar from the various :mod:`socket` and
    :mod:`asyncio` methods.
    *delay*, *interleave*, *async_dns* and *resolution_delay*
    control Happy Eyeballs-specific behavior.
    *local_addrs* is a new argument providing new features not specific to
    Happy Eyeballs.

    Args:
        host: Host name to connect to. Unlike
            :func:`asyncio.create_connection`
            there is no default, but it's still possible to manually specify
            *None* here.

        port: Port number to connect to. Similar to **host**, *None* can be
            specified here as well.

        family: Address family.
            Specify :data:`socket.AF_INET` or :data:`socket.AF_INET6` here
            to limit the type of addresses used. See documentation on the
            :mod:`socket` module for details.

        proto: Socket protocol. Since the socket type is always
            :data:`socket.SOCK_STREAM`, proto can usually be left unspecified.

        flags: Flags passed to :func:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.getaddrinfo`.
            See documentation on :func:`socket.getaddrinfo` for details.

        local_addr: *(local_host, local_port)* tuple used to bind the socket to
            locally. The *local_host* and *local_port* are looked up using
            :func:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.getaddrinfo` if necessary,
            similar to *host* and *port*.

        local_addrs: An iterable of (local_host, local_port) tuples, all of
            which are candidates for locally binding the socket to. This allows
            e.g. providing one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. Addresses are looked
            up using :func:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.getaddrinfo`
            if necessary.

        delay: Amount of time to wait before making connections to different
            addresses. This is the "Connect Attempt Delay" as defined in
            :rfc:`8305`.

        interleave: Whether to interleave resolved addresses by address family.
            0 means not to interleave and simply use the returned order.
            An integer >= 1 is interpreted as
            "First Address Family Count" defined in :rfc:`8305`,
            i.e. the reordered list will have this many addresses for the
            first address family,
            and the rest will be interleaved one to one.

        async_dns: Do asynchronous DNS resolution, where IPv6 and IPv4
            addresses are resolved in parallel, and connection attempts can
            be made as soon as either address family is resolved. This behavior
            is described in :rfc:`8305#section-3`.

        resolution_delay: Amount of time to wait for IPv6 addresses to resolve
            if IPv4 addresses are resolved first. This is the "Resolution
            Delay" as defined in :rfc:`8305`.

        detailed_exceptions: Determines what exception to raise when all
            connection attempts fail. If set to True, an instance of
            :class:`~async_stagger.exceptions.HappyEyeballsConnectError`
            is raised, which
            contains the individual exceptions raised by each connection
            and address resolution attempt.
            When set to false (default), an exception is raised the same
            way as :func:`asyncio.create_connection`: if all the connection
            attempt exceptions have the same ``str``, one of them is raised,
            otherwise an instance of *OSError* is raised whose message contains
            ``str`` representations of all connection attempt exceptions.

    Returns:
        The connected :class:`socket.socket` object.
